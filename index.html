            Hello my name is, Amritpal Dhillon. I was born and raised in California.
            I am 26 years old and currently working in a web developer bootcamp. 
            <br>
            Upon completion of this course, I hope to find a career in website design.
            Soon after I will be looking to get into a graphic design program, and in the future specialze in this area.
            <br>
            I have always been creative and have had a knack for design. So turning this passion into a career is my biggest priority.

        </p>
